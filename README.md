# ionic-migration-v4
A markup migration tool from ionic-v3 to ionic-v4, following the [breaking changes](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/core/packages/ionic-angular/BREAKING.md)

## Current state
Currently this is self contained. There is the `v3` folder, that after running `node migrate` will create a `v4` folder with the migration done on it.

## Goal
When this is finalized, either get this into `ionic-cli` or make a different CLI for it
